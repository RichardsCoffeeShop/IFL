#### Expected rewrite changes:

- [ ] MacOS build
- [ ] Bind to remove current song from playlist (or make it work on the same keybind, idk)

--------


#### Features

IFL - is a program build with electron & react with redux.

Main goal of this project is to help you be more productive with adding new songs to your spotify playlists :)

How it works?
- Download latest release. Install it. Login with your spotify account.
- Now you need to choose one or any amount of PUBLIC AND PRIVATE playlists you have.
